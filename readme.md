# Anki Pinyin Add-On

This is an add-on for Anki 2.1 that simplifies Chinese pinyin input. It converts
numbers 1-4 placed after each syllable to pinyin tone marks and then colourizes
each syllable according to its tone. Note that the colours corresponding to each tone
are currently hard coded (1 - blue, 2 - red, 3 - green, 4 and neutral - no colour/black).

Use at your own risk.

Example:

```
Wo3 zai4 xue2 zhong1wen2.
```

after pressing the "tones" button will be replaced with:

```
wǒ zài xué zhōngwén.
```
